# Railway.toml - Railway Deployment Configuration
# ======================================================================================
# This file tells Railway how to build and deploy your app.
#
# WHAT IS RAILWAY?
# Railway is a cloud platform that makes deploying apps easy.
# Website: https://railway.app
#
# HOW TO DEPLOY:
# 1. Push your code to GitHub
# 2. Go to railway.app and create a new project
# 3. Connect your GitHub repository
# 4. Railway will automatically detect this file and deploy!
#
# SETTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
# In Railway dashboard, go to your project > Variables tab, and add:
# - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY (copy from your .env file)
# - DJANGO_DEBUG=0 (for production)
# - DATABASE_URL (if using Railway's PostgreSQL add-on, this is auto-set)
# ======================================================================================

[build]
# Use Dockerfile to build the app
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "./Dockerfile"

# Only rebuild when these files change (saves build time)
